# Econ5821-Final
This GitHub repository is for the **Econ5821 final exam**, managed by **Yuchen Song and Yixuan Su**. The project focuses on predicting the U.S. inflation rate using machine learning models, and this repository will document our methods and main results.

Seperate files such as "AR(1).ipynb", "LASSO.ipynb" and "Decision Tree.ipynb", contain our initial training/validation process and out-of-sample forecasting using the false testing data. Parts of these contents are compiled in Final Report(False) for verification and reference.

The final report can be found in **"Final Report.ipynb"**. Only sections like out-of-sample forecasting are modified in this report, with no changes made to the model training and in-sample-fit code on May 16. 

Thank you!
